# rba-analysis
Monte carlo analysis of the risk score analysis methodology.

## Notes:  
While the code was designed by the authors (IE and JW), we notify readers/users that we used AI to aid in converting some longer, high-computation tidyverse functions into more effecient vectorised functions.  
The nature and objectives of those functions remained as we intended, AI just helped us edit the code in a manner than allowed functions to run in minutes rather than hours!  
The AI industry runs at a sprint: the analysis was run across the Spring of 2025, and we used the DeepSeek 4 model wrapper available at that time in the private Venice AI app.
